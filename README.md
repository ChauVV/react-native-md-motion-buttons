# react-native-md-motion-buttons

I wanted to re-create this animation with react-native (https://dribbble.com/shots/1945593-Login-Home-Screen)

![Example](examples/doc/button.gif)

**This is actually a proof of concept and only tested with iOS.**

# Installation

`npm install react-native-md-motion-buttons --save`

# Usage

Take a look here : [examples/index.ios.js](examples/index.ios.js)

# Roadmap

## MVP Version

- [ ] test with Android
- [x] add examples
- [ ] add to the npm registry

## Next release

- [ ] Add ripple effect for button
- [ ] Add a Floating Action Button (FAB) which will move to the center (like inVision dribble)
