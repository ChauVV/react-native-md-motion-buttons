# react-native-animated-transition

I wanted to re-create this animation with react-native (https://dribbble.com/shots/1945593-Login-Home-Screen)

![Example](https://cdn.dribbble.com/users/62319/screenshots/1945593/shot.gif)

This component is only the transition, to have the full animation you will need my [loading button](https://github.com/zecaptus/react-native-loading-button), but it can works with your own buttons ;) (Actually both components are in, I will separate them later)

**This is actually a proof of concept and only tested with iOS.**

# Roadmap

## MVP Version

* Separate both components
* test with Android
* add package.json
* add tests
* add examples
* add to the npm registry

## Next release

* Add ripple effect for button
* Add a Floating Action Button (FAB) which will move to the center (like inVision dribble)
